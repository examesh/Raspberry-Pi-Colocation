[Raspberry Pi Colocation](https://examesh.de/en/instances/pi/colocation/) Service Within Our Own Edge Data Centers


## About
There are some colocations available for Raspberries. However, we wanted to create a special one. Due to our long experience with decentralized edge data centers we can now offer a special rack space: We provide your Pi in one of our small decentralized edge data centers inside a wind turbine or a solar park.

And the best part? The locations are operated 24/7 with green energy. So your Pi is not only truly decentralized, but also climate-neutral in operation!

### Colocation
The locations are currently spread all over Germany. In the future, further locations are to follow throughout the EU.

### Features
✅ Unlimited traffic
✅ Public IPv6 address
✅ No setup fee
✅ Green energy
✅ EU Privacy
✅ Location Germany

### Edge Data Center
Your Raspberry will be installed in our self-developed air-conditioned rack:

### Raspberry Pi
Send us your Raspberry Pi and additional hardware.

## Booking
Two simple steps.

### 1. Configure the colocation
Configure the colocation according to your needs and pay only for what you need.  Our configurator allows up to 60 different individual colocations through specifications such as rack space or additional sockets.

### 2. Order Colocation
Click on "Order now" and you will enter the one-page checkout. Fill in your address and select a payment method. ✅ There is no setup fee.

## Configure your device
After the colocation is booked, you will find all necessary informations about how to configure your device. Please make always a backup of your final configured SD card.

## Send

After you have read all the instructions on the administration page and finished configuring your Pi, you can prepare the package.

For the shipping label, please note the following: Be sure to add as c/o the ID that is displayed on the administration page. It can look like this: `4212:938332`. It is important that this ID is on the label, otherwise the package cannot be correctly and automatically assigned to your booking at the head office.


## Deployment

After receiving your Pi, it usually takes 24-48 hours to install it in the edge data center of your choice. 
Once your Pi is installed, you will receive an email notification from us.

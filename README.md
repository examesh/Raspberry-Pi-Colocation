**[Raspberry Pi Colocation](https://examesh.de/en/instances/pi/colocation/)** Service Within Our Own Edge Data Centers


## About
There are some colocations available for raspberries. However, we wanted to create a special one. Due to our long experience with decentralized edge data centers we can now offer a special colocation.

Your Raspberry Pi in one of our decentralized data centers. We neither rent rackspace, nor do we operate centralized, huge data centers. We provide your Pi in one of our small decentralized edge data centers inside a wind turbine or a solar park. Of course, we leave the choice of location up to you at checkout.

And the best part? The locations are operated 24/7 with green energy. So your Pi is not only truly decentralized, but also climate-neutral in operation!

### Colocation
The locations are currently spread all over Germany. In the future, further locations are to follow throughout the EU.

Best of all, EU locations mean EU privacy.

### Edge Data Center
Your Raspberry will be installed in our self-developed air-conditioned rack. For this we have also developed our own rack mounts, which are produced by 3D printing.

## Configure

After the colocation is booked, you will be automatically redirected to the administration page. There you will find all the necessary information to prepare your Raspberry Pi.

`Please note: Make a backup of your SD card in any case.`

## Send

After you have read all the instructions on the administration page and finished configuring your Pi, you can prepare the package.

For the shipping label, please note the following: Be sure to add as c/o the ID that is displayed on the administration page. It can look like this: `4212:938332`

It is important that this ID is on the label, otherwise the package cannot be correctly and automatically assigned to your booking at the head office.


## Deployment

After receiving your Pi, it usually takes 24-48 hours to install it in the edge data center of your choice. 
Once your Pi is installed, you will receive an email notification from us.
